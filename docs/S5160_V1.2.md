![TMC5160](images/TMC5160.jpg)

The TMC5160 is a high power stepper motor controller and driver IC with serial communication interfaces. It combines a flexible ramp generator for automatic target positioning with industries’ most advanced stepper motor driver. Using external transistors, highly dynamic, high torque drives can be realized. Based on Trinamic's sophisticated SpreadCycle™ and StealthChop™ choppers, the driver ensures absolutely noiseless operation combined with maximum efficiency and best motor torque. High integration, high energy efficiency and a small form factor enable miniaturized and scalable systems for cost effective solutions. The complete solution reduces learning curve to a minimum while giving best performance in class. TMC5160-WA uses a wettable flank package to allow optical inspection of the soldering joints.

###  Mode selection

![5160模式选择](images/5160模式选择.jpg)

​    The FYSETC S5160 V1.2 defaults to SPI mode. If you need to change to Standalone mode, you need to change the jumper as shown.

### F6 jumper for TMC5160 SPI mode

![F6_5610](images/F6_5610.png)

If you are using the TMC5160 SPI mode on the F6, you do not need extra wiring, just plug in the jumper cap on the F6 as shown.
