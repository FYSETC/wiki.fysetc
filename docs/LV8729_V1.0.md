### Motor Current Setting

![LV8729-current-setting](images/LV8729-current-setting.jpg)

Current limits can be adjusted by measuring the VREF and the adjustable resistance (pls check wiring diagram). Connect the voltmeter + to VREF, [-] to the GND and read the value.
LV8729 uses 0.10ohm current sense resistor, so the current limits can be calculated as follows:
[Current Limit = VREF x 2]
