###  Wiring Diagram

![TMC2225-wiring](images/TMC2225_wiring.png)

!!!Tip
    The TMC2225 outputs continuous motor current up to 1.4A and peak current up to 2A. Therefore, the reference voltage of the driver module should not exceed 1V. At the same time, the driver module must be heat dissipated, otherwise it will affect the life of the driver module.

### Motor Current Setting  (Same As TMC2208)

![TMC2208-current-setting](images/TMC2208-current-setting.png)

The best way to set the motor current is by measuring the voltage on the Vref pin (0…2.5V) and adjusting the voltage with the potentiometer. The maximum settable motor current is 1.77A RMS (0.11Ohm sense resistors), but the SilentStepSticks can only be used up to 1.2A RMS.  
Irms = (Vref * 1.77A) / 2.5V = Vref * 0.71  
Vref = (Irms * 2.5V) / 1.77A = Irms * 1.41 = Imax   
Vref -> Voltage on Vref pin  
Irms -> RMS (Root Mean Square) current per phase (Irms = Imax / 1.41)  
Imax -> Maximum current per phase (Imax = Irms * 1.41)   

!!!Note
​    1. Vref measures Gnd and the voltage at the middle of the potentiometer.  
​    2. Do not connect the motor when measuring the voltage, otherwise it is easy to burn the driver.  
​    3. Power should be connected when measuring voltage, do not just connect USB power supply.

VIO	| VIO | 1⁄32 | 1⁄256 | stealthChop2

## OTP Setting (Refer to TMC2208)
---

With the TMC2208 Configurator you can change the settings and program the OTP (One-Time-Programmable) memory of a Trinamic TMC2208 via the UART interface.

###  To run the program:
1. Install ScriptCommunicator
2. Download TMC2208.scez
3. Start the TMC2208.scez file with the ScriptCommunicator: ScriptCommunicator TMC2208.scez
4. Choose the right serial port and click Connect
5. Modifications in the Configurator are directly transmitted

!!!Tip
​    The OTP bits can be programmed only one time.
​    If you enable spreadCycle then TOFF cannot be 0 (null).

### Hardware Connection

![TMC2208-hardware-connection](images/TMC2208-hardware-connection.png)

You can use every RS232 serial adapter with 0-5V logic levels (e.g. FTDI-Breakout) and the SilentStepStick Tester/Programmer can be used as connection adapter.

!!!Tip
​    The jumper next to the PDN_UART pin has to be closed on the TMC2208 SilentStepStick to enable the pin access via the pin header.


## Firmware Setting (Same As TMC2208)
---

You don't need to set the firmware, just need to set the microstep to the firmware through MS2, MS1, usually it is 16 microsteps.

If you want use UART mode, Please confirm that your wiring is correct.

And then，you can perform some column configuration on the driver through firmware.
The setup steps are as follows:

##### 1. Wiring

For your convenience, we have made adjustments to all the new TMC drivers in the new version. We have added pin headers that extend the board for the position where you may need wiring (SPI or UART).

For the UART, we added a 1K resistor to the board, providing RX and TX directly, and you don't need to solder.

For F6 or similar boards, please forget the above two points and cut off the extended pin headers, They are of no use to you.   Just install it directly on the board,  and following the instructions of the board.

For the board that needs wiring, please refer to the picture below:

![TMC2225_Uart_Mode_Wiring](./images/TMC2225_Uart_Mode_Wiring.png)

##### 2. Configration.h

   Remove the "//" in front of the axis you need to use the TMC2225 driver，and change the stepper driver type，I assume you need the XY axis.

   ```c++
   /**
    * Stepper Drivers
    *
    * These settings allow Marlin to tune stepper driver timing and enable advanced options for
    * stepper drivers that support them. You may also override timing options in Configuration_adv.h.
    *
    * A4988 is assumed for unspecified drivers.
    *
    * Options: A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, L6470, TB6560, TB6600, TMC2100,
    *          TMC2130, TMC2130_STANDALONE, TMC2208, TMC2208_STANDALONE,
    *          TMC26X,  TMC26X_STANDALONE,  TMC2660, TMC2660_STANDALONE,
    *          TMC5130, TMC5130_STANDALONE
    * :['A4988', 'DRV8825', 'LV8729', 'L6470', 'TB6560', 'TB6600', 'TMC2100', 'TMC2130', 'TMC2130_STANDALONE', 'TMC2208', 'TMC2208_STANDALONE', 'TMC26X', 'TMC26X_STANDALONE', 'TMC2660', 'TMC2660_STANDALONE', 'TMC5130', 'TMC5130_STANDALONE']

   //#define E3_DRIVER_TYPE A4988
   //#define E4_DRIVER_TYPE A4988
   ```

   ##### 3.Configration_adv.h

   Here, I usually recommend using the default value. But if you need to configure the current and subdivision, you can do it in Configure_adv.h. If you want to configure other options, please read the TMC2225 datasheet to make sure you know the result of your own operation.

   ```c++
   // @section tmc_smart
   
   /**
    * To use TMC2130 stepper drivers in SPI mode connect your SPI pins to
    * the hardware SPI interface on your board and define the required CS pins
    * in your `pins_MYBOARD.h` file. (e.g., RAMPS 1.4 uses AUX3 pins `X_CS_PIN 53`, `Y_CS_PIN 49`, etc.).
    * You may also use software SPI if you wish to use general purpose IO pins.
    *
    * You'll also need the TMC2130Stepper Arduino library
    * (https://github.com/teemuatlut/TMC2130Stepper).
    *
    * To use TMC2208 stepper UART-configurable stepper drivers
    * connect #_SERIAL_TX_PIN to the driver side PDN_UART pin with a 1K resistor.
    * To use the reading capabilities, also connect #_SERIAL_RX_PIN
    * to PDN_UART without a resistor.
    * The drivers can also be used with hardware serial.
