## Firmware Guide

------

#### Download Vscode + platformio

To compile the firmware , you need to install Visual Studio Code and the platformio pulg-in.

#### Download firmware

You can download the firmware from https://github.com/FYSETC/Marlin-2.0.x-FYSETC , and if you want to know what we have changed , we recommend to use git to get the code .

The firmware you download is for Cheetah board in default，you need copy the configuration.h & configuration_adv.h from config/Fysetc/AIO_II to the marlin folder.

The latest configurations are in separate repository [here](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.0.x), you can download and find the config in config/Fysetc/AIO_II folder

#### Compile the firmware

Open Vscode and open platformio main page and click the "Open Project" button , and direct to the folder where you put your firmware.

![1561099422559](images/AIO_f1.png)

If everything goes fine , at the bottom you can see several buttons

![1561099546202](images/AIO_f2.png)

The check mark is for compiling .

Open platformio.ini file and change the option default_envs as below.

default_envs = fysetc_STM32F1

And then replace the default configuration.h and configuration_adv.h with files locate in FIRMWARE_LOCATE\Marlin\Marlin\config\examples\FYSETC according to your board.

Then click check mark to compile.

If you can't generate the hex file, you may need to open vscode using Administrator Account .

For more detail information，you can refer to http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio.html

#### Upload the firmware(windows,linux,Mac)

We provide several ways to upload the firmware .You can just click the upload button to upload the firmware or refer to the two methods below.

#### Upload the firmware(windows)

After compiling , you should see the firmware file "firmware.hex" in the folder FIRMWARE_LOCATE\Marlin\Marlin\\.pioenvs\fysetc_STM32F1\

Download the flash software in our github https://github.com/FYSETC/STM32Flasher

Connect the board and your pc with USB cable (This step should before you open the software)

Double the click "FlyMcu.exe" software to open it.

![1561100540118](images/AIO_f3.png)



1. Select "***Reset@DTR low(<-3v),ISP @RTS High***"
2. Click "Port" to select the port of your USB 
3. Select ***FIRMWARE_LOCATE\Marlin\Marlin\\.pioenvs\fysetc_STM32F1\firmware.hex*** as the screenshot shows.
4. At last ,click the "Start ISP(p)" to upload the firmware.

#### Upload the firmware(linux)

##### Load usb driver

Delete the old version driver /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ch341.ko

```
rm /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ch341.ko
```

Download the CH34x driver(linux version) from our github

https://github.com/FYSETC/CH340-Driver

follow the readme.txt to make and load the driver .

If you want the driver load automatically every time your PC power up. You can copy the ch34x.ko file to 

directory /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ , and do

```
depmod 
```

##### Install stm32flash tool

First get the code

```
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/stm32flash/code stm32flash-code
```

Then follow the INSTALL file to install the software

##### Upload the firmware

Connect the motherboard with USB cable and your PC. And do

```
dmesg
```

And you will get message like 

![1562654867797](images/AIO_f4.png)

the ttyUSB0 is the port to communicate with the motherboard.

And then go the the firmware.hex file location directory and do the follow command to upload the firmware

```
 stm32flash -w firmware.hex -v -i rts,-dtr /dev/ttyUSB0
```
