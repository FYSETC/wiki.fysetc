![TMC5161](images/TMC5161.jpg)

The TMC5161 is a highly compact stepper motor controller and driver IC. Its power stage is optimized for lowest power dissipation and highest dynamics with Nema 17 and Nema 23 motors. It combines a flexible ramp generator for automatic target positioning with industries’ most advanced stepper motor driver. Based on TRINAMICs sophisticated SpreadCycle and StealthChop choppers, it ensures absolutely noiseless operation combined with maximum efficiency and best motor torque. High integration, high energy efficiency and a small form factor enable miniaturized and scalable systems for cost effective solutions. The complete solution reduces learning curve to a minimum while giving best performance in class. Interface compatible to TMC5160.

| PIN/MODE | SPI Mode | SPI Moed | UART Mode | Standalone Mode |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------------- |
| SPI      | 1        | 1        | 0         | 0               |
| SD       | 1        | 0        | 0         | 1               |

The FYSETC S5160 V1.1 version now defaults to SPI mode (SD=1 and SPI=1). If you want to use another mode, you need to change the jumper yourself according to the instructions above.
