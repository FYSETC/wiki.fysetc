![TMC2208](images/TMC2208.jpg)

TMC2208 is an ultra-quiet two-phase stepper motor drive chip, continuous drive current 1.4A, peak current 2A, voltage range 4.75V-36V, 256 subdivision. The flexible microPlyer interpolation unit provides up to 256 subdivisions, allowing perfect sinusoidal control even in systems with limited pulse frequencies; these are also designed because stealthChop2 ultra-quiet technology is widely used in 3D printing. Compatible with existing 3D printer electronics, eliminating the expensive costs of redesign. With a standard step/dir interface, it is easy to use. It can replace the original TMC2100, lower heat, especially for 3D printing market.

###  Wiring Diagram

![TMC2208-wiring-diagram](images/TMC2208-wiring-diagram.png)

!!!Tip
​    The TMC2208 outputs continuous motor current up to 1.4A and peak current up to 2A. Therefore, the reference voltage of the driver module should not exceed 1V. At the same time, the driver module must be dissipated, otherwise it will affect the life of the driver module.

### Motor Current Setting

![TMC2208-current-setting](images/TMC2208-current-setting.png)

The best way to set the motor current is by measuring the voltage on the Vref pin (0…2.5V) and adjusting the voltage with the potentiometer. The maximum settable motor current is 1.77A RMS (0.11Ohm sense resistors), but the SilentStepSticks can only be used up to 1.2A RMS.  
Irms = (Vref * 1.77A) / 2.5V = Vref * 0.71  
Vref = (Irms * 2.5V) / 1.77A = Irms * 1.41 = Imax   
Vref -> Voltage on Vref pin  
Irms -> RMS (Root Mean Square) current per phase (Irms = Imax / 1.41)  
Imax -> Maximum current per phase (Imax = Irms * 1.41)   

!!!Note
​    1. Vref measures Gnd and the voltage at the middle of the potentiometer.  
​    2. Do not connect the motor when measuring the voltage, otherwise it is easy to burn the driver.  
​    3. Power should be connected when measuring voltage, do not just connect USB power supply.

## Setting Method
---

With the TMC2208 Configurator you can change the settings and program the OTP (One-Time-Programmable) memory of a Trinamic TMC2208 via the UART interface.

###  To run the program:
1. Install ScriptCommunicator
2. Download TMC2208.scez
3. Start the TMC2208.scez file with the ScriptCommunicator: ScriptCommunicator TMC2208.scez
4. Choose the right serial port and click Connect
5. Modifications in the Configurator are directly transmitted

!!!Tip
​    The OTP bits can be programmed only one time.
​    If you enable spreadCycle then TOFF cannot be 0 (null).

### Hardware Connection

![TMC2208-hardware-connection](images/TMC2208-hardware-connection.png)

You can use every RS232 serial adapter with 0-5V logic levels (e.g. FTDI-Breakout) and the SilentStepStick Tester/Programmer can be used as connection adapter.

!!!Tip
​    The jumper next to the PDN_UART pin has to be closed on the TMC2208 SilentStepStick to enable the pin access via the pin header.

## Versions Difference
